Who is it, so early in the morning? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Good morning, Detective. I am Phillip Anderson, assistant to Mr. Jenkins. I'm afraid I bring dreadful news. #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Come in, Mr. Anderson. What seems to be the problem? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
It's Mr. Jenkins, Detective. He...he's dead. Poisoned, it seems. #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Poisoned? Are you certain? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Yes, Detective. The ship's doctor believes so. He had his dinner last night and then... he never woke up. #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
That's most unfortunate. Did the doctor ascertain the type of poison? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Not yet. But the Captain, in his wisdom, has locked up Chef Sullivan under suspicion of poisoning Mr. Jenkins' food. #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
That's a severe accusation. Was there any evidence pointing towards him? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
None that I know of, but the Captain seems convinced that the poison came from the kitchen. #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I see, that complicates things. I need to speak with the Captain, and I must see this Chef Sullivan. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, Mr. Anderson. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
