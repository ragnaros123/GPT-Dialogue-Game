Everyone, may I have your attention, please? I have important news to share.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: left
In light of recent events, namely the deaths of Ms. Palmer, our steward, and Mr. Jenkins, a prominent passenger, we have apprehended a suspect.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: left
The Chef, Marvin Sullivan, is currently under arrest for suspicion of murder.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: left
We believe the poison that killed Mr. Jenkins originated from the kitchen, hence the decision.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: left
I assure you all, justice will be served.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: left
The suspect will be handed over to the authorities as soon as we reach the shore.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: left
Hold on, Captain Bennett.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: right
While it's crucial to maintain order and assure passengers, we must ensure we're not jumping to conclusions prematurely.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Detective, I understand your concern.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: left
But we had to act, given the circumstances.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: left
Agreed, Captain.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: right
But it's also crucial to not overlook other possible leads.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: right
I urge you, let's tread carefully.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: right
We owe it to the victims, and to those innocent until proven guilty.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: right
But Detective, the Captain must have had his reasons to suspect the chef, isn't that right, Captain Bennett?  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Indeed, Mr. Anderson.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: left
We didn't arrest Chef Sullivan on mere speculation.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: left
This morning, we found a bottle of poison in his drawer.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: left
The ship's doctor confirmed it to be hydrogen cyanide, a highly potent poison.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: left
While the discovery of the poison is significant, what could have been Chef Sullivan's motive?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: right
Detective, as you may or may not know, Mr. Jenkins had been unhappy with Chef Sullivan's cooking lately.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: left
He threatened to have him removed from his position.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: left
Imagine, losing her livelihood on this ship!  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: left
The fear, the rage, the desperation... it's enough to drive a person to the unthinkable.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: left
A plausible motive for Mr. Jenkins' murder, yes.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: right
But why would the Chef kill Ms. Palmer, the steward?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: right
Maybe they had an argument we don't know about... or perhaps... perhaps, Detective, the steward's death was nothing but a tragic accident in the first place.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: left
Is that not enough for you, Detective?  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: angry #layout: left
Are you not satisfied accusing Marvin of these horrendous crimes?!  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: angry #layout: left

+ [Yes, I am satisfied]
My apologies, Captain, if my questioning seemed harsh.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
I only seek to leave no stone unturned.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
I understand, Detective.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
In the meantime, Chef Sullivan will be held in confinement.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Once we reach the shore, she'll be handed over to the authorities.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Well done, Captain Bennett.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: happy #layout: left
We have faith in your leadership.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: happy #layout: left
We appreciate your efforts, Detective White, and yours too, Captain Bennett.  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: grateful #layout: right
We're grateful for the swift actions you've both taken.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: grateful #layout: right
Our hearts are with you in these challenging times.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: grateful #layout: right
~gameOver = true

+ [No, I am not satisfied]
Of course not, Captain!  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
What do you mean, Detective?  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
There's a crucial contradiction in our findings that we've overlooked.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
Contradiction? What are you referring to, Detective?  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
If you have proof, present it.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
