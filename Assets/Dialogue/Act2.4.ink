Good day, Mr. Anderson. I'm Detective White. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Detective, how may I assist you? #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I am investigating the incidents that have occurred recently. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
I understand you had a role in the events leading up to Ms. Palmer's death. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Can you elaborate on your actions? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Yes, of course. #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I was rather displeased with the food last evening. #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: sad #layout: right
So, I decided to take it up with the captain. #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
I went to the bridge along with Beatrice, the maid. #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
That would be when you lodged your complaint about the quality of food? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
Precisely. #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
We requested the captain to have a word with the chef. #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Beatrice went to fetch Chef Sullivan. #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
But as I understand, you didn't wait for her to return? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
No, Detective. #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: sad #layout: right
When Beatrice didn't return for a while, I decided to go find her myself. #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
But you didn't find her or Chef Sullivan, did you? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
Actually, on my way, I ran into Mrs. Jenkins. #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
She told me her husband required my presence for some unfinished business. #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
So I went to their room. #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: explaining #layout: right

+ [About the merchant]
I would also like to discuss the unfortunate passing of Mr. Jenkins.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
I understand you've worked closely with him for many years?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Yes, Detective.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: sad #layout: right
I've been at Mr. Jenkins' side for over a decade.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: sad #layout: right
He was more than just a boss to me.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: sad #layout: right
His death... it's devastating.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: sad #layout: right
My condolences, Mr. Anderson.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Can you recall the events of last night?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
When did you last see Mr. Jenkins alive?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
After our business meeting, I left him in his chambers.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
The mistress was with him.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I did not see him after that.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Did anything seem off to you last night?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
Any signs of distress or unusual behavior?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
Now that you mention it, Mr. Jenkins did seem a bit perturbed after dinner.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: sad #layout: right
But I thought it was just his typical displeasure with the food.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: sad #layout: right

+ [About the family]
Mr. Anderson, could you shed some light on the other members of Mr. Jenkins' family?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Of course, Detective.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Arthur, the elder son, is ambitious and driven, very much like his father.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
He's been involved in the family business from a young age.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
And the younger son, Jonathan?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Jonathan is quite different.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
He's an introvert, keeps to himself mostly.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
He's got a knack for chemistry though.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
I see.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
I also want to tell you that it may be possible that Chef Sullivan isn't our culprit.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
Oh! That's surprising.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: shocked #layout: right
But who else could it be?  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: thinking #layout: right
That's what I'm trying to find out.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
You said Jonathan has a knack for chemistry.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
Could he possibly have access to poisons?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
Well, now that you mention it, it is possible.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
His studies often involve dealing with different chemical compounds.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
He would have knowledge about poisons.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Mr. Anderson, can you speak more about Jonathan's relationship with his family?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
I must say, Detective, it's not a good one.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: sad #layout: right
There's been a lot of resentment, especially after Mr. Jenkins remarried.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
He always felt overlooked in favor of his older brother Arthur.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: sad #layout: right
So there's a possible motive there?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
It's quite possible, Detective.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Jonathan has always been unhappy.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: sad #layout: right
Perhaps it drove him to commit this terrible act.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: sad #layout: right
And how about Beatrice, the maid?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
You mentioned she delivered food to Mr. Jenkins.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Yes, Beatrice has been serving the family for quite a long time.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
She does take meals to Mr. Jenkins, but I find it hard to believe she'd poison him.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Does she have a reason to?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
Not that I'm aware of, Detective.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
She's been loyal to the family, kept to her duties.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I see no motive.  #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Thank you, Mr. Anderson.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: happy #layout: left
These insights provide further avenues to explore.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: happy #layout: left
Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: happy #layout: left
