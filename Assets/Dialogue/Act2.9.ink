Good day, Doctor. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
I've come to ask about the reports for the deaths of the steward and the merchant. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Can you provide any additional details from your examination? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Of course, Detective. #speaker: Dr._Leonard #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I've completed the autopsies as you requested. #speaker: Dr._Leonard #portrait: neutral #layout: right
For the steward, her death is quite clearly due to the severe trauma from her fall down the staircase. #speaker: Dr._Leonard #portrait: explaining #layout: right
There's a fracture to the skull which was likely the immediate cause of death. #speaker: Dr._Leonard #portrait: explaining #layout: right
However, there's something more. #speaker: Dr._Leonard #portrait: explaining #layout: right
There were some minor abrasions and bruising on her arms that suggest a struggle prior to her fall. #speaker: Dr._Leonard #portrait: explaining #layout: right
So, it wasn't a simple accident? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
It's hard to say definitively without more evidence, but the injuries are suggestive of a potential altercation before the fall. #speaker: Dr._Leonard #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Now, the merchant, he was poisoned. #speaker: Dr._Leonard #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Traces of cyanide were found in his stomach contents. #speaker: Dr._Leonard #portrait: explaining #layout: right
The poison would have killed him within an hour after ingestion, depending on the dose. #speaker: Dr._Leonard #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Thank you, Doctor. This information could be very helpful to the investigation. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: happy #layout: left
