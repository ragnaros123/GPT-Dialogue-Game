Good day, Mr. Sullivan. I'm Detective White.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
What's good about it, sir? #speaker: Marvin_Sullivan #portrait: angry #layout: right
I'm in the brig, accused of a crime I didn't commit. #speaker: Marvin_Sullivan #portrait: angry #layout: right
I'm here to get to the bottom of this, Chef Sullivan. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
That's why I need your cooperation. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
Can you recount the events of last night for me? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left

+ [About the night before]
Chef Sullivan, what happened last night, leading up to the steward's death?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
I... I was cooking for Mr. Jenkins, just like every other night.  #speaker: Marvin_Sullivan #portrait: sad #layout: right
Then Beatrice, the maid, suddenly came to fetch me.  #speaker: Marvin_Sullivan #portrait: sad #layout: right
And she took you to the Captain?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Yes, sir.  #speaker: Marvin_Sullivan #portrait: sad #layout: right
And the Captain... he told me that Mr. Jenkins was unhappy with my food.  #speaker: Marvin_Sullivan #portrait: shocked #layout: right
He threatened me... said he'd have me lose my job!  #speaker: Marvin_Sullivan #portrait: shocked #layout: right
I understand this might be distressing, Mr. Sullivan, but this is crucial.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Please, continue.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
I was shocked, Detective.  #speaker: Marvin_Sullivan #portrait: sad #layout: right
I pride myself on my skills...  #speaker: Marvin_Sullivan #portrait: sad #layout: right
And then, when Beatrice and I returned to the kitchen, we found Rachel's body at the bottom of the stairs.  #speaker: Marvin_Sullivan #portrait: sad #layout: right
That must have been a shock.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
And after you found Ms. Palmer?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
I... I couldn't believe it.  #speaker: Marvin_Sullivan #portrait: sad #layout: right
I was scared, so I...I drank, Detective.  #speaker: Marvin_Sullivan #portrait: sad #layout: right
I drank until I passed out in my quarters.  #speaker: Marvin_Sullivan #portrait: sad #layout: right
When did the guards come to your quarters?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
This morning.  #speaker: Marvin_Sullivan #portrait: sad #layout: right
They searched my room, said they found a bottle of poison.  #speaker: Marvin_Sullivan #portrait: sad #layout: right
But I swear, Detective, I know nothing about it.  #speaker: Marvin_Sullivan #portrait: sad #layout: right
I see.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left

+ [About the poison]
Now, let's discuss the bottle of poison found in your quarters. Can you explain how it got there?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Poison? In my quarters? I... I don't know anything about that, Detective. I swear!  #speaker: Marvin_Sullivan #portrait: shocked #layout: right
It was found during a search this morning. Are you certain you have no idea how it got there?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
I'm certain, sir. I've never seen it, never touched it.  #speaker: Marvin_Sullivan #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Someone must have planted it there!  #speaker: Marvin_Sullivan #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Alright, Chef Sullivan. I'll take your word for it, for now.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
I'll investigate this further.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
We will need to verify the substance in that bottle and match it with the poison that killed Mr. Jenkins.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
Maybe it's time that I visited Mr. Jenkins to listen to his account.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
