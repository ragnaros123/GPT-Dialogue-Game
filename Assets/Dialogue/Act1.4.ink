Hmmm, seems like the kitchen's deserted.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
The kitchen appears cleaned, recently scrubbed down. If there were traces of evidence, they might be lost now.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
But, why would anyone clean at such a late hour? It seems a bit out of place.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
It's pretty late, and I doubt I will find the chef at this hour. I'll have to continue my inquiry tomorrow.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Marvin Sullivan, the chef, is next on my list. I need to understand what she might know about Rachel's last moments in this kitchen.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
