+ [About last night]
Can you recount your activities from yesterday afternoon onward, Mr. Jenkins? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
I was here, at the bar. #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Started mid-afternoon, I reckon. #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
And you stayed here throughout the entire evening? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
That's right. #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I had no reason to leave. #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Good company, good drinks, what more could a man want? #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: happy #layout: right
Can anyone vouch for your whereabouts? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Ask anyone here. #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Bartender, servers, the ladies. They'll tell you the same. #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right
I didn't step a foot out of this bar. #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right

+ [About the family]
Can you describe your family dynamics to me, Mr. Jenkins?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Well, detective, I've been treated rather well by my parents.  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right
We've had our disagreements, as any family does, but nothing more than that.  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I understand. And what about your brother?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Does he share the same sentiments?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Jonathan? No, he's always been the black sheep, unfortunately.  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: sad #layout: right
Dad never really understood him and his fascination with chemicals and such.  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Mum tries to mediate, but Dad's a stubborn one.  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Do you think your brother could have a motive to harm your father?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
That's a strong accusation, detective.  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: angry #layout: right
Thomas isn't exactly in the best of terms with our parents, yes, but to go to the extent of murder?  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: angry #layout: right
I don't think so.  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
It's just a possibility we need to consider, Mr. Jenkins.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
What is your relationship with your brother?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Despite our differences, and the way our parents feel about him, Thomas and I are rather close.  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right
He's family, after all.  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right
I would never believe he could do something this horrific.  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: sad #layout: right
Detective, there is something that has been bothering me, and I feel like it might be important.  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right

+ [About the strange matter]
Is there something else that has been bothering you, Mr. Jenkins?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
It's a bit embarrassing, Detective, but I can't seem to shake off this suspicion.  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: sad #layout: right
I've seen my mother and Mr. Abernathy, the assistant, together quite a lot recently.  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: sad #layout: right
It's probably nothing, but it has been bothering me.  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: sad #layout: right
Have there been any unusual incidents or conversations that caught your attention?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Actually, yes.  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: thinking #layout: right
I found this letter at the bottom of my mother's drawer when I was looking through her things...  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: sad #layout: right
I shouldn't have, but I did.  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: sad #layout: right
Can I see the letter?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Sure, here it is.  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
It's signed by P.A., Philip Abernathy, and it talks about making preparations for something important.  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right
This is indeed suspicious.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
The contents of this letter could suggest a number of possibilities.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
Do you think it could be... an affair?  #speaker: Arthur_Jenkins #portrait: sad #layout: right
It's too soon to jump to conclusions, Mr. Jenkins.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
It could mean many things.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
However, I will take this into account during the investigation.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
Thank you for bringing this to my attention.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: happy #layout: left
