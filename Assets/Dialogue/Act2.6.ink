+ [About ealier last night]
Beatrice, I need you to recount everything that happened on the night of Rachel's death. Can you do that for me?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Yes, I can try, sir.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
After dinner, the assistant, Mr. Anderson, and I went to complain to Captain Bennett about the quality of the food.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Mr. Anderson asked me to fetch Chef Sullivan, which I did.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
And what happened then?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
We returned to the bridge.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I was asked to leave.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
After a few moments, I went back to fetch Mr. Anderson.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
But he wasn't there.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: sad #layout: right
He said he was going to look for me.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Did you see where he went?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
No, sir.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I thought he'd gone to the kitchen.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: thinking #layout: right
But when I went there, I saw Rachel lying at the bottom of the stairs.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: shocked #layout: right
I didn't know what to do.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: sad #layout: right
So I ran to get the Captain.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: sad #layout: right
Did you see anyone else during this time?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
No, sir.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
The halls were empty at the time.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: neutral #layout: right

+ [About later last night]
And what happened after you discovered Rachel's body, Beatrice?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
I was so scared, sir.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: scared #layout: right
But I had to continue my work.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I went to the kitchen.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I prepared the food.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
And brought it to the merchant's chamber.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
And who did you see in the merchant's chambers?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Only the merchant himself, sir.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
He was sitting alone in the room.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Only the merchant?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
What about his wife, Mrs. Jenkins or his assistant, Mr. Anderson?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
No, sir, I didn't see either of them.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: sad #layout: right
I am sure.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: sad #layout: right
It was only the merchant.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: sad #layout: right
That's strange.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
Mrs. Jenkins and Mr. Anderson told me they were present in the room when the food was brought in.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
That can't be right, sir.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: shocked #layout: right
I swear, the merchant was alone.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Maybe they came in after I left, but when I was there, I saw no one but Mr. Jenkins.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Thank you for your honesty, Beatrice.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: happy #layout: left
This has certainly given me something to think about.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left

+ [About the two sons]
Beatrice, can you tell me about Mr. Jenkins' sons?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Where were they last night?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Sir, the elder son, Mr. Arthur, he was on the top deck.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
He was... well, he was drinking and entertaining some ladies.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
And what about the younger son, Jonathan?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Jonathan, sir? He's... well, he keeps to himself.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Last night, he was in his room.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I checked on him before I retired for the night, and he was busy with his books and chemicals.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
He didn't look like he was going anywhere.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Did you see anything unusual with either of them?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Or did they mention anything out of the ordinary?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
No, sir.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: neutral #layout: right
They both seemed as they always do.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Mr. Arthur being the social one and Mr. Jonathan locked away in his own world.  #speaker: Beatrice_Thompson #portrait: explaining #layout: right
