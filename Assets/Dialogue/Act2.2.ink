Captain Bennett, I heard about the recent development.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Yes, Detective. It's a tragedy. Two deaths in such a short time.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I never imagined...  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: shocked #layout: right
Indeed, it's a grim situation.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
I'm curious, where were you last night after you left me?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
I was on the bridge, Detective.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Spent the entire night there.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
The weather was turning, needed to keep an eye on things.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: right
And can any of the crew members vouch for your whereabouts?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
Yes, the entire crew on the night shift can.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
They were with me, on the bridge.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: thinking #layout: right

+ [Before the death of the steward]
Captain, let's rewind a bit. I'm interested in the events surrounding Ms. Palmer's death. What were you doing when she was allegedly murdered?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
I was in my cabin when Mr. Anderson and Beatrice, Mr. Jenkins' maid, came to me with complaints about the food. #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: right
They asked me to discuss the matter with the chef. #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: right
You said they asked for the chef. Why didn't they go directly? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
It's the protocol on board, Detective. Any complaints about the staff need to be routed through me. #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: right
I see. What happened next? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
I sent Beatrice to fetch the chef. #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: right
But she didn't return for quite a while. #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: right
That's when Mr. Anderson decided to go after her. #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: right
And what about when they returned? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
Beatrice returned with Chef Sullivan. #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: right
I discussed the issue with him. #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Mr. Jenkins was quite upset, threatened to have the chef lose his job. #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: right
After that, I let the chef go. #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Then what happened? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
Not too long after that, Beatrice came rushing back. #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: right
She reported that they'd found Rachel... Ms. Palmer, dead. #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: right
This account is critical, Captain. It seems we have a clear timeline for the night of Ms. Palmer's death. I appreciate your cooperation. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left

+ [About the chef]
Captain, let's discuss Chef Sullivan's imprisonment. What lead you to suspect him?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
This morning, we searched his quarters.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: right
We found a bottle of poison hidden there.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: right
It seemed like solid evidence to me, Detective.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: right
A bottle of poison, you say.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
Have you tested it to confirm it's indeed poison?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
We haven't, Detective.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: right
It was labeled as such, and given the circumstances...  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: right
We need to be sure, Captain.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
A mislabeled bottle could lead us down the wrong path.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
We should also verify if it's the same poison that killed Mr. Jenkins.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
I see your point, Detective.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: right
We'll have the ship's doctor examine it right away.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Thank you, Captain.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: happy #layout: left
While you do that, I'll go speak with Chef Sullivan.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
This case is taking quite the turn.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
