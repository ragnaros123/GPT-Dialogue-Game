Come in, please. What brings you here?" #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Good day, Detective White. I'm Captain Bennett of the ship you're currently aboard. #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
A pleasure, Captain Bennett. Please have a seat. Now, what seems to be the issue?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
It's quite unfortunate, but we've had an accident onboard. One of our stewards, Rachel Palmer, was found dead.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
That's a grave matter indeed. Can you describe the situation?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
It seems Miss Palmer might have fallen down a staircase during the storm we had last night. It was quite chaotic, hard to see.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I see, it's never easy losing a crew member. Did anyone witness the incident?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
No, not as far as we know. That's why we believe it to be an accident.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
A tragic incident, indeed. Rest assured, Captain, I will look into this matter right away.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: leftThere may be more than meets the eye.

+[how you knew about me]
Interesting, Captain. Yet, I must ask - how is it you came to seek me out for such an inquiry?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
I've heard about your work, Detective White. You have a certain reputation for... unraveling the intricate, shall we say.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Ah, my reputation precedes me. But specifically, how did you come to know about me?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
An old friend, Constable Harris from the Metropolitan Police. He mentioned your name in high regard when we were discussing a different case a while back.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Harris, indeed? He is a good man, knows his craft well. So, you've brought me a case that appears as an accident but your instincts say otherwise?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
Precisely, Detective. There's a foul air about the whole matter that I can't quite put my finger on. But I trust you can.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right

+[about the ship]
Very well, Captain. Now, enlighten me about this vessel of yours.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
She's a grand dame, sir. The SS Majestic, one of the largest transatlantic steamships of our time.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
The SS Majestic, indeed a worthy name. How many souls does she carry?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
About a thousand passengers and two hundred crew on a full voyage, Detective.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
A small floating city, isn't it? Now, tell me about the kind of passengers she carries. Any notable ones?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Yes, the Majestic attracts a wide variety of passengers. Wealthy families, business moguls, even dignitaries. On this particular journey, we have the Jenkins family onboard, led by Thomas Jenkins, a rather influential merchant.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Thomas Jenkins... I've heard that name before. Any others?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
None that immediately spring to mind, Detective. But the Jenkins family is accompanied by a number of associates and employees.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Sounds like a crowd. I will need the passenger manifest and the crew list, Captain.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Of course, Detective. I will have them sent to your room at once.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right

+[about the crime scene]
Now, about the crime scene. Any peculiarities?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
At first glance, nothing out of the ordinary. A flight of stairs, a poor woman who seemingly lost her footing in the storm.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
And who discovered Ms. Palmer?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
Phillip Anderson, sir. He's the assistant to Mr. Jenkins, the merchant.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I see. And what was Mr. Anderson's state when he found the body?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
Seemed truly shocked, sir. He immediately called for help.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Quite so. And the area has been secured, I trust?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
Indeed, Detective. No one's been allowed in or out since it was discovered.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Excellent. Now, I believe it's high time I visited this scene myself, Captain Bennett.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
