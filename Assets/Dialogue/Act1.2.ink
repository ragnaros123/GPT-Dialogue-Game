Captain, I believe we need to reevaluate the nature of this incident.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Oh? What makes you say that?  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
As I observed the crime scene, I noted a few inconsistencies with the accidental fall theory.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
Firstly, there are signs of a struggle.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
This railing here, it's been broken recently and forcefully.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
Could have been the storm...  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Normally, I'd agree, Captain.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
But look closer, there's a small trace of fabric caught on the splintered wood.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
It matches the steward's uniform.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
Interesting...  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: thinking #layout: right
Secondly, I noted scrapes on the stair edges.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
These are not caused by mere tripping or slipping, but rather by someone forcefully dragged down.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
This is concerning...  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: thinking #layout: right
And thirdly, her injuries are inconsistent with a fall down the stairs.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
The angle and location of the wounds suggest she might've been pushed from a higher deck, not just a staircase fall.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
My God! Are you implying...  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: shocked #layout: right
Yes, Captain.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
It's quite possible that this was not an accident but rather a crime.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
Of course, we'll need more evidence to confirm this hypothesis.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
But as it stands, I believe we're dealing with a murder.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
Now, Captain Bennett, I need to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left

+ [About where the stairs lead to]
Captain, can you tell me what is directly above these stairs?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Directly above? That would be one of our kitchens, the one specifically meant for preparing meals for our special guests.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I see, and does this staircase lead anywhere else?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
No, Detective. This staircase primarily provides access to the kitchen and the storage below it.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Interesting. This seems to narrow down the scope of our investigation.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
How so, Detective?  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
If the struggle began in the kitchen and ended with Ms. Palmer's fall, it's likely our suspect was someone present in or around the kitchen at the time of the incident.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
That would narrow it down to the chef and the kitchen staff...  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Yes, Captain. However, keep in mind, we're yet to establish this as a murder conclusively.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
We should approach this subtly to avoid alarming potential suspects.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left

+ [Last sightings of the steward]
Now, Captain, can you recall where the steward was last seen?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Yes, she was summoned to Mr. Jenkins', the merchant's chambers.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
He had a complaint about the food's quality.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
A complaint about the food... From the kitchen she supposedly fell from. Interesting.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
And after her visit to Mr. Jenkins, did anyone see her?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
I've asked around and it seems that was her last known location.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
No one seems to have seen her after that, Detective.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
That's critical information, Captain.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Given the circumstances, it's crucial that I speak with Mr. Jenkins.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
He might provide us with valuable insights into the steward's final hours.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
I'll arrange a meeting with Mr. Jenkins right away, Detective.  #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Excellent, Captain.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: happy #layout: left
Every bit of information brings us closer to the truth.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: happy #layout: left
