Why, Detective, I didn't expect company at dinner. What a delightful intrusion. #speaker: Thomas_Jenkins #portrait: happy #layout: right
My apologies for the disturbance, Mr. Jenkins. This matter is of utmost importance. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Well, it better be. Now, spill it out. What brings you here? #speaker: Thomas_Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I'd like to discuss your conversation with Ms. Palmer, the steward, on the night of her demise. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Oh, that? She came to hear my complaints about the chef's miserable attempts at cuisine. #speaker: Thomas_Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Can you recall if she seemed agitated or worried during this conversation? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Worried? Agitated? No, she was as stoic as always. #speaker: Thomas_Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Took my complaints and promised to rectify them. #speaker: Thomas_Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I see. What did you do after she left? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
What's it to you? Oh, never mind, just stayed in my chamber. All night. #speaker: Thomas_Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Were you alone? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
No, my younger son, Jonathan, was with me. #speaker: Thomas_Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Are you implying I had anything to do with her death? Preposterous! #speaker: Thomas_Jenkins #portrait: angry #layout: right
I assure you, Mr. Jenkins, it's a routine inquiry. We're trying to construct a timeline. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Well, construct away, Detective. But do try to keep out of my dinner hours. #speaker: Thomas_Jenkins #portrait: angry #layout: right
（Coughs） #speaker: Thomas_Jenkins #portrait: angry #layout: right
I dislike interruptions during my meal, you are giving me a real headache. #speaker: Thomas_Jenkins #portrait: angry #layout: right
 I understand, Mr. Jenkins, and I appreciate your cooperation. Enjoy your dinner. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
If his statements hold true, Jenkins does have a solid alibi. But there's something about his demeanor that doesn't sit well with me. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
It's too early to rule him out. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
The kitchen, that's where I need to go next. The chef may provide more insights into this puzzle. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
