The autopsy report prepared by the ship's doctor stated that Mr. Jenkins died within an hour after consuming his meal. However, Mrs. Jenkins, you claimed that your husband was awake for several hours after dinner. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left

That... I... #speaker: Mrs_Jenkins #portrait: shocked #layout: right

Why would you lie about this, Mrs. Jenkins? What are you hiding? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left

It... it wasn't my idea. #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: sad #layout: right

What are you talking about, Elizabeth? #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: confused #layout: left

You did it, Phillip. You're the murderer. You told me that if we got rid of my husband, we could finally be together, that we could live the life we always dreamed of. #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: angry #layout: right

Lies! She's lying! #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: angry #layout: left

Mrs. Jenkins, were you an accomplice to this crime, or are you a victim as well? #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left

I didn't know he would actually do it... I didn't know he'd kill him... #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: sad #layout: right

Shut up, Elizabeth! Shut up! #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: angry #layout: left

Enough, Mr. Anderson. The truth always finds a way to reveal itself. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left

Let's take this from the beginning. Mr. Anderson, you meticulously planned the murder of Mr. Jenkins from the outset. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left

It started with the theft of the bottle of poison from young Mr. Jenkins' cabin, a fact he seemed eager to share. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left

From that moment, you had your murder weapon. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left

You needed an alibi, so you artfully arranged for Captain Bennett to be your witness. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left

You requested the maid, Ms. Thompson, to call the chef, Mr. Sullivan, from the kitchen, leaving the place unattended and ripe for your devious plan. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left

Slipping into the vacant kitchen, you poisoned the special meal meant for Mr. Jenkins. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left

You were in a hurry, a man on a deadly mission, but unfortunately for you and the late steward, she stumbled upon you. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left

She wasn't part of your plan, and to ensure she wouldn't unravel your scheme, you had no choice but to kill her. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left

In a panic, you left her body at the bottom of the stairs, trying to make it look like an accident. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left

A heinous act, and a desperate attempt to cover your tracks. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left

After the murder, you went to Mrs. Jenkins. You knew she'd be vulnerable, confused, and more importantly, loyal to you. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left

You fed her the story that would cement your alibi, knowing she would stand by you, her lover. #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left

This is outrageous! I deny all of these false allegations. I did not... #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: angry #layout: right

Enough! Your games end here, Anderson. #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: angry #layout: left

Guards! Arrest this man immediately. He will be turned over to the police upon reaching the shore. #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: angry #layout: left

You can't do this to me! I demand... #speaker: Phillip_Anderson #portrait: angry #layout: right

Your demands mean nothing now. You will face justice for your crimes. #speaker: Samuel_Bennett #portrait: angry #layout: left
