+ [About last night]
Mrs. Jenkins (The wife), could you please provide a detailed account of what transpired last night?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Yes, Detective.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
It was a normal evening.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
We had finished dinner.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
The assistant, Phillip, came by.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
He and my husband were discussing some business matters.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Did you observe anything unusual during their interaction?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
No, it was the usual talk about their dealings.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Phillip seemed a bit stressed but that was not uncommon.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I see. And what happened after Mr. Anderson left?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Beatrice, our maid, brought in the night meal as she usually does.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
She left soon after and my husband and I retired for the night.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Did your husband eat anything from that meal?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Yes, he had a small portion.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
He complained about the taste but he always did.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Did you notice anything odd after he has eaten?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
I see. Could you tell me about the next morning?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
I... I woke up to find him...  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: shocked #layout: right
He was still in bed, cold...  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: shocked #layout: right
I called for help immediately...  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: shocked #layout: right

+ [About the food]
Can we talk more about the food brought in by the maid?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Of course, Detective.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Beatrice has been bringing us our meals for years.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right
It's part of her daily routine.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Did you notice anything different about the food or how it was served?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Not that I can recall, Detective.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
It was served as usual, on a tray with a cover.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right
And your husband ate this food without any suspicion?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Yes, he did.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
He always had a small meal before bed.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Did you share this meal with your husband, Mrs. Jenkins?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
No, Detective.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I generally don't eat late at night.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right
It doesn't sit well with me.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Did you notice anything odd after he had the meal?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
He was coughing a bit.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right
He went to bed after a few hours.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right
A few hours?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
What was he doing after that?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
Yes, he finished his business.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right
And went to sleep after he was done.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right

+ [About the family]
Mrs. Jenkins, could we talk about your sons, Arthur and Jonathan?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Yes, Detective.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
They are both very different.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Arthur is ambitious, much like his father.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
He's next in line to take over the family business.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Does Arthur have any issues that might impact this?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Well... Arthur does have a drinking problem.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
It's a concern, but I don't think it would drive him to harm his father.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Could you tell me more about Arthur's drinking problem, Mrs. Jenkins (The wife)?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
It started a few years ago.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
He's always had a liking for the finer things in life.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
But recently, it's become more of a dependency.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
His father and I have tried to help him, but he denies he has a problem.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
How has this affected his relationship with his father?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
It's strained, for sure.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Thomas... my husband, didn't tolerate any kind of weakness.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
But he never stopped believing in Arthur's ability to lead our business.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
What about your younger son, Jonathan?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Jonathan... He's always been the black sheep of the family.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Could this tension lead to anything drastic?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
I don't want to believe it, but... Jonathan's always been fascinated with chemicals.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
It's an obsession, really.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
It worries me, Detective.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
I see.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Now, tell me more about Jonathan's obsession with chemicals.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
It started as a curiosity in school.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
But as he grew older, it became an obsession.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
He spends hours locked in his room, experimenting with different substances.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
Did your husband know about this?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Yes, and it terrified him.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
He saw it as a threat, not just to our family, but to others on this ship.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
They've had many heated arguments about this, Detective.  #speaker: Mrs._Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
