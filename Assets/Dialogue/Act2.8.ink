+ [About last night]
Good day, Mr. Jenkins. I'm Detective White, I'm investigating the recent unfortunate events.
Hello, Detective. I suppose it's about my father's death?
Yes, I'm sorry for your loss. I wanted to ask you a few questions if you're up for it.
I suppose I don't have a choice, do I? Go ahead, ask away.

+ [About the family]
Your mother mentioned that your relationship with your father was rather strained. Could you tell me more about that?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
Yes, it's true. My father and I didn't see eye to eye.  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: neutral #layout: right
He was always stricter with me than my elder brother.  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right
He never appreciated my interest in chemistry, always saying it's a waste of time.  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: sad #layout: right
Could you give me some examples?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
There were many instances.  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right
He once threw out my chemistry set, saying it was a distraction.  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: angry #layout: right
He often compared me to my elder brother, saying I should be more like him.  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: sad #layout: right
That sounds tough. But your mother also suspects you might have a reason to harm your father.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: neutral #layout: left
Yes, I've heard. But that's absurd.  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: shocked #layout: right
Killing him wouldn't change anything.  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: sad #layout: right
I would be a prime suspect, it wouldn't solve my problems.  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: sad #layout: right
It would only make them worse.  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: sad #layout: right
And what about your relationship with your elder brother? Your mother said he's closer to you than she is.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
My brother... he's always been there for me.  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: happy #layout: right
Despite our differences, we've managed to maintain a close bond.  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: happy #layout: right
He defended me when father was too harsh, and supported my interests.  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: happy #layout: right
I could never do anything to harm him.  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: sad #layout: right

+ [About your hobbies as a chemist]
Jonathan, your interest in chemistry has been noted by a few people on board. With your father's death being caused by poisoning, it does raise some questions.  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: explaining #layout: left
Could someone have taken your chemicals to poison him?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
I...I never thought of it that way.  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: shocked #layout: right
I mean, I do have a variety of chemicals, but I never thought they could be used like that.  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Let me check...  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: thinking #layout: right
Wait...there is a bottle missing!  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: shocked #layout: right
A bottle of cyanide is missing! It's a deadly poison!  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: shocked #layout: right
But I didn't give it to anyone! I swear! I don't know how it went missing.  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: explaining #layout: right
Could anyone have access to your room and your chemicals?  #speaker: Oliver_White #portrait: thinking #layout: left
I don't lock my room often...So, yes, anyone could have walked in and taken it, but I never thought someone would.  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: sad #layout: right
I thought I was among trustworthy people...I...I didn't think it could lead to this.  #speaker: Jonathan_Jenkins #portrait: sad #layout: right
